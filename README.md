files
=====

Add your files to the files folder and put the description of them into the [`module.yml`](./module.yml) file.

This is just an empty module. It contains nothing. You can put files into the web folder that is created when you run [`bin/update.sh`](bin/update.sh).
You can edit the description in the [`module.yml`](./module.yml) file and it will turn up in the [overview](https://github.com/cdpoffline/overview). This can be an example of a simple module.
